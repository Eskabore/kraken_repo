# kraken_repo

Intro:

At the beginning of the project, the main idea was to create an environment for people in Berlin to meet & exchange goods and/or information.
  After weeks if not months of trying to get a more structured idea, it became obvious than **"starting"** writing down the ideas would be more beneficial than holding them in grey matter.
 Nevertheless, there was no expectation into creating something new but, -instead-, developping one or several ideas already in place and adapting them to a more local perspective.
 
The enthusiasm into developing the kranken repo is growing on and on.
